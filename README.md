# Tech Interview

## Expected Work

- Write a small express API to login a user with username and password. No need to make a database, the username and password can be hardcoded for simplicity.
**Remember what matters most is how you organise your work.**

## Intention

This test simulates a scenario where the *Tech team* needs to create a new service in production.
This test aims to evaluate the following candidate skills :

### Technical level

- the technical level in a NodeJS ecosystem (npm, yarn, etc.)

### Team player skills

- the ability to use tools or patterns in order to improve productivity, robust code

### Workflow

- the way of reasoning (i.e. the way of obtaining the result is very important, rather than just the result)
- the way of organizing work on a feature

## Guidelines

- code should be clean (Latest ECMA syntax, layer separation)
- tests should be present (Show your best skills : TDD, unit, integration and more)
- Assume that only `npm`, `yarn` and `node` LTS are already installed
- documentation files should be added
- comments in code could be added when you need to clarify a design decision or assumptions about the spec

- [duplicate](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) this repository (do **not** fork it)
- **commit often and atomically** to show the evolution of the code step by step
